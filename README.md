# artefactswithoutCVEonGitHubAdvisoryDatabase
This is a list of artifacts from the GitHub Advisory Database where the corresponding JSON files are missing CVE identifiers, despite the fact that these artifacts are listed in the NVD (National Vulnerability Database). I cross-referenced the data, retrieved the missing CVEs, and compiled everything into a list.
